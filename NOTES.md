# Notes/Summary

- "Methods define a new thing that your program can do."
- "Variables are like nouns, methods are like verbs."

```ruby
def greeting # Method Signature
  puts "Hello World" # Method Body
end # Method Closing
```

- made [greeting.rb](greeting.rb)

> Note: Programmers love conventions, or agreed upon rules that help them talk to each other about code. A common syntax convention for Ruby methods is to preface them with a `#`, and in subsequent lessons, you might see methods written with a `#` in front of the method name. For example, if a method is named 'greeting', rubyists will often refer to it as `#greeting`. This is so that other rubyists can instantly recognize it as a method, as opposed to a variable or a bareword or a class.  But remember that when you write it in your code, it should be `greeting` and not `#greeting`.
